# Weather Data Analysis

This project analyzes weather data using Python and pandas. All analysis steps are combined in a single cell for a streamlined workflow, and a plot visualizes the average temperature by weather condition.

## Features
- Loads and inspects the dataset
- Explores unique weather conditions
- Performs filtering and grouping
- Calculates statistics (mean, std, variance)
- Handles missing values
- Renames columns for clarity
- Advanced filtering and groupby operations
- All analysis steps are combined in one cell for convenience
- Visualizes average temperature by weather condition (bar plot)

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `notebook/weather_data.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.
2. Run the final cell to execute all analysis and view the plot.
3. Make sure the dataset is present at `datasets/dataset.csv`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset should be placed in the `datasets` folder as `dataset.csv`. It contains weather records with columns like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather condition.
